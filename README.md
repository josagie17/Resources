Kickstarter assignment

Overview of Project
Based on data collected from a fundraising campaign, i want to analyze how different campaign fared in relations to there their launch dates and their funding goals. the data contains 19 columns and 4114 records.

Purpose
the purpose of this project is to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals

Analysis and Challenges
Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on "launch date" we observed that May and June are the months with most success, while the month of December showed the least success.

Overall there were 1369 compearable results within the year 2009-2017 covered in the dataset. The percentage of observation based on outcome are as shown below. Successful campaign:61% failed campaign:32% canceled campaign:7%

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
As the goal amount increases the percentage success reduces, while as the goal amount reduces the percentage success increases

Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The table seem to contain too much information It could be defecult to completly analyze the data using excel pivot table and chart

Results
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? May and june are the best months to launch campaign Campaign activity is lowest in December

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Taking "plays" as the subcategories in focus, our analysis based on goals shows the following: We observed that the goal range "less than 1000" recorded the highest success rate 76% (141) count followed by the range 1000-4999 at 73% followed by 388 count out of 534.

As the goal amount increases beyond 2000 the percentage successful reduced, while percentage failed increased

What are some limitations of this dataset? Not able to analyze on yearly basis There is the need to analyze for all subcategories

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? we could create tables or graphs to analyze the following: Outcome based on country Outcome based on currency Outcome based on deadline Outcome based on categories Outcome based on subcategories
